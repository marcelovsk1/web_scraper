# === DE-DUPLICATE EVENTS ===
# 1. similarity test of event names --> find a library that calculates a similarity score bewteen strings
# for example: "New Year Party" = "NY Party"
# 2. if we have troubles with this way, we could do embeddings but that is slighty more difficult to implement

# === FORMAT ELEMENTS (we have to check how is this formatted in the database) ===
# 1. Date -> Python datetime Object
    # if events from the same website have their date formatted the same way, then you could make a special formatting function
    # for each website
    # Facebook: "Fri 3, October" => function to output day, month, year =>> ({ day: 3, month: 10, year: null }) // 2024
    # you can use those elements to create a new datetime object in python which will be use to save the date in the database in the same way as the other dates

# 2. Location
    # a. If it's stored as simple string, then we could be fine
        # maybe we still need to do some cleaning to format location the same way (Montreal <> Montréal)
    # b. If we need coordinates, or more information on the location, or to format it the same way
        # I would use Google Places API which take as input an unformated dalocationte and returns a formatted place
        # it has a cost but it's usefull (like Google Maps)

# 3. Image URL
    # => no special need but depending on the current way of saving image
    # we would need to save the image in our own servers like the other images

# make a list of duplicate events to compare

# scrape secondary pages

# gpt prompt for generating tags from title and description
